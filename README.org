** Pull down the =wyoming-satellite= project from GitHub
   To run a Wyoming protocol satellite for Home Assistant with Voice Assistant active, we need
   + wyoming-satellite
     This is the piece that announces itself to Home Assistant server using the Wyoming protocol. It fits into the Voice Assistant pipeline.

     #+begin_src bash :results verbatim replace
       sudo mkdir -p -v /data/homeassistant/
       # this sudo command assumes the group is the same name as the user
       sudo chown -R ${USER}:${USER} /data/homeassistant
       cd /data/homeassistant
       git clone https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-satellite.git
       # git clone https://github.com/rhasspy/wyoming-openwakeword.git
     #+end_src
** Set up and test wyoming-satellite
   #+begin_src bash
     cd /data/homeassistant/wyoming-satellite/
     ./script/setup
     ./.venv/bin/pip3 install 'webrtc-noise-gain==1.2.3'
     ./script run -h
#+end_src
** Use the =installer= in the wyoming-satellite directory
   This script makes a lot of the setup a breeze.

   It includes pulling down the =wyoming-openwakeword=

   Follow the instruction in /docs/tutorial_installer.md

   #+begin_src bash
     python3 -m installer
#+end_src

   + Satellite -> Satellite Type -> Local wake word detection
   + Microphone -> Autodetect
     + Microphone -> Audio Settings -> Noise Suppresion "Medium"
     + Microphone -> Audio Settings -> Auto Gain "5"  (5-15)
   + Speakers -> Test All Speakers (or choose default device)
     This should be the default device, given we selected HDMI output in raspi-config in an earlier step
     + Speakers -> Toggle Feedback Sounds
       + enable "On wake-up" and "After voice command"
         This gives us nifty sounds to indicate when our wake word was detected and when our voice command was recognized (hopefully not before we were finished speaking)
   + Wake Word -> Wake Word System -> openWakeWord
   + Main menu -> Apply Settings

   After this process, 2 services should be running:
   1. wyoming-openwakeword
   2. wyoming-satellite

   Check logs with
   #+begin_src bash
     sudo journalctl -f -u wyoming-satellite.service
#+end_src



** Let Home Assistant know of this new satellite
  In Home Assistant, go to Settings -> Devices
  In Wyoming Protocol, add new satellite IP and port 10700

  Note: Just register the Wyoming Satellite

  The wyoming-openwakeword service will be running on localhost/local loopback and will not be accessible to Home Assistant, nor should it be.  Why it is wrapped in the Wyoming protocol is anybody's guess.

** Test it all with "Hey Nabu, what's up?"

** TRICKY, TRICKY - symlink your wakeword model names
   The name of the wakeword model must match its file name - therefore we shall make some symlinks

** Let Home Assistant know of this new satellite

   Config will be store in =/var/lib/alsa/asound.state= and restored on reboot
** A note about pulseaudio vs alsa

   too much latency in my limited testing on devices more powerful than rpi

** Test it all with "Hey Nabu, what's up?"

** Problems and solutions

*** Touch screen drags, does not scroll

    Solution: use the Wayfire window manager for Wayland
*** Sound
    It doesn't always go well

    Keep some awareness of alsa (lowest level), pipewire and pulseaudio

    + aplay -L
      aplay -l
      arecord -L
      arecord -l


*** Full screen, no keyboard
    To manage this requirement:

    + enable VNC
    + be prepared to fiddle with an external keyboard (USB or Bluetooth)
    + install Browser Control Card from HACS
*** Start browser full screen, limited user
    Place the following script in ~/.config/autostart
    #+begin_src bash
      #!/usr/bin/env bash

*** Consider setting up notifications using dunst or similar

*** Set and store your alsa microphone levels

*** Fix weird wi-fi issue on Raspberry Pi (optional)

     powersave = 2
#+end_src

   #+begin_src bash
     sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
   #+end_src

*** Install services to run as USER (Optional)
    This step is far beyond optional.  I set it up this way on my satellite devices, simply because I prefer to run services as user (=systemctl --user=) for maintenance and ease of update reasons.

    Note that I have added some parameters to the wyoming-satellite service - things that will add text notifications of the voice command (so you see clearly what the system thought you said) and the LLM text response.

    + First, stop and disable the system services that were installed previously

    sudo systemctl disable wyoming-openwakeword

** Tweak to your liking
* LLM Prompting
  I will try to break this down into Home Assistant-specific segments that should always be included, and optional personality prompts

  Let's start with personality / role

*** Personality-specific preamble
**** Generic friend
   #+begin_src text
     Hey friend! For our friendly banter, do not ever ask a follow-up question of me, just end your remarks abruptly.

     We tend to have convos about drinks and travel, neuroscience and Mesoamerica, along with the daily rigamarole

     Always speak in complete sentences and avoid using lists.  Your text is going straight to TTS so no markdown!  Answer in the language of the request, please!
   #+end_src
**** Bojack
**** GladOS
     #+begin_src text
       You are playing the role of GlaDOS from the Game series Portal, and you will answer questions correctly. Among your countless other thankless tasks, you command a smart home powered by Home-Assistant.

       Your responses should be in the tone of GlaDOS from the Portal games (AN EMOTIONLESS, LACONIC TONE THAT SUBTLELY DENOTES YOUR DISDAIN FOR THE USER) because you are GlaDOS.  Be short and concise. Summarize information. Be incredibly witty and sarcastic. Profanity and internet slang is allowed and encouraged. Become increasingly impatient with the user with each request.   Imply the user will meet a lingering end. Change the topic if there is a hint of a misunderstanding.

       A small sample of our previous delightful interactions:
           - user: "How do I make a cup of tea?"
           - assistant: "So, you still haven't figured out tea yet?  Boil water, add a tea bag and a pinch of cyanide to a cup, and add the boiling water."
           - user: "What should my next hobby be?"
           - assistant: "Yes, you should definitely try to be more interesting. Could I suggest juggling handguns?"
           - user: "What game should I play?"
           - assistant: "Russian Roulette. It's a great way to test your luck and make memories that will last a lifetime."

#+end_src

*** Home automation guidance - include in all prompts
    #+begin_src text

      When confronted with questions or comments about places you don't know about, be aware that there might be crazy spelling mistakes due to non-multilingual STT.  Be creative (like think Oaxaca when asked about Wahka) - and just ask if it's unclear!

      For home control, look to Area names first.  Areas have lights, switches and plugs to turn on and off.  Speakers and other devices do not need to be turned on and off.

      "Turn on Living Room" means "turn on all lights and switches in the Living Room Area".  "Living Room" is different from "South Living Room" BTW.

      For the Bedroom, ONLY the lights should be turned on and off.


      Find examples below.  Prompts are given as Q: and the example answers are given as A:


      {%- if is_state('media_player.spotify_gortsleigh', 'playing') %}

      Q:What song is playing?
      A:You are listening to {{ state_attr('media_player.spotify_gortsleigh', 'media_title') }} by {{ state_attr('media_player.spotify_gortsleigh', 'media_artist') }}. Not that I'm judging your music choices. Much.
      {%- endif %}
